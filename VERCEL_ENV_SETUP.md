## 🎯 What to Test

Once deployed, test at: `https://your-app.vercel.app/test-upload`

Fix:
1. Go to Cloudflare R2 dashboard
2. Click `chapturs-images` bucket
3. Settings → Public Access
4. Enable "Allow Public Access"
5. Save

### Images upload but don't display

**CORS configuration needed**

    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600
