## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Enhanced Logging (4 files modified)
Better visibility throughout the authentication and API flow:

```typescript
// auth.ts
✅ User upserted: { email, id, username }
✅ Author profile ready: { authorId, userId }
[Session Callback] Setting session.user.id from token.sub

// /api/works (POST)
[POST /api/works] Creating work for user: ...
[POST /api/works] ✅ IDs match: YES

// /api/creator/works (GET)
[GET /api/creator/works] Fetching works for userId: ...
[GET /api/creator/works] Found 3 works
```

### Standardized Queries
Changed author lookups from `findFirst()` to `findUnique()`:
- More semantically correct (userId is @unique)
- Better performance
- Clearer intent

### New Diagnostic Endpoint
**File:** `src/app/api/creator/debug/route.ts`

Provides comprehensive report:
- All users with your email
- All author profiles
- All works and their linkages
- Diagnosis of specific issue
- Recommendations

### New Fix Endpoint
**File:** `src/app/api/creator/fix-works/route.ts`

Automatically:
- Creates author profile if missing
- Finds works under old/duplicate authors
- Migrates to current session author
- Reports what was done

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### The Problem
```
User creates works → Linked to Author A
User accesses hub → Queries Author B (different ID!)
Result: No works found ❌
```

### The Solution
```
1. Diagnostic identifies mismatch
2. Fix migrates works A → B
3. Hub queries Author B
4. Result: Works found ✅
```

---

## 📊 Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Deploy
```bash
git checkout copilot/investigate-creator-hub-issue
# Wait for Vercel deployment (~2 minutes)
```

### Step 2: Diagnose
```
Visit while logged in:
https://your-app.vercel.app/api/creator/debug
```

Expected output:
```json
{
  "diagnosis": {
    "possibleIssue": "WORKS_UNDER_DIFFERENT_AUTHOR" or "NO_AUTHOR_PROFILE" or "NO_WORKS_CREATED"
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Fix (if needed)
```javascript
// In browser console:
fetch('/api/creator/fix-works', { method: 'POST' })
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(console.log)
```

Expected output:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "migrated": 3,
  "message": "Successfully migrated 3 work(s)..."
}
```

### Step 4: Verify
Check these pages:
- ✅ `/creator/glossary` - Works should appear
- ✅ `/creator/characters` - Works should appear
- ✅ `/creator/dashboard` - Correct counts

### Step 5: Cleanup
Delete these files before production:
```bash
rm -rf src/app/api/creator/debug/
rm -rf src/app/api/creator/fix-works/
git commit -m "Remove diagnostic endpoints after fix"
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### ⚠️ Temporary Endpoints
These endpoints are **diagnostic tools only**:
- `/api/creator/debug` - Exposes user data
- `/api/creator/fix-works` - Modifies database

**MUST be removed** or **protected** before production!

### ✅ Production-Safe Changes
These are safe to keep:
- Enhanced logging (no sensitive data)
- Standardized queries (improvement)
- All code modifications

---

## 📈 Expected Results

### Before Fix
- Works visible after creation ✅
- Works NOT in `/creator/glossary` ❌
- Works NOT in `/creator/characters` ❌
- Works NOT in `/creator/dashboard` ❌
- Work count shows 0 ❌

### After Fix
- Works visible after creation ✅
- Works in `/creator/glossary` ✅
- Works in `/creator/characters` ✅
- Works in `/creator/dashboard` ✅
- Work count accurate ✅

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Still not working after fix"
1. Check Vercel logs for errors
2. Run diagnostic again
3. Verify works exist in Supabase
4. Share diagnostic output in PR

### Issue: "Diagnostic shows NO_WORKS_CREATED"
- This means no works exist in database
- Try creating a new work
- Check if using correct account/email

### Issue: "Fix migrated 0 works"
- Works are already correctly linked
- Check diagnostic for details
- May not be a data issue
