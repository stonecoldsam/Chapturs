# Creator System Improvements Summary

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. **Upload Page Restructure**
- **Original Issue**: Upload page was section management instead of work creation flow
- **Solution**: Completely restructured `/creator/upload` to be the first step of work creation
- **Features Implemented**:
  - Work title and description form
  - Content format selection (novel, article, comic, hybrid)
  - Genre selection with predefined options
  - Tag management system
  - "Create Work & Start Writing" button that redirects to editor
- **Flow**: Upload → Create Work → Redirect to Editor for content writing

### 2. **Font Family Error Fix**
- **Original Issue**: "There is no mark type named 'textStyle'" error in editor
- **Solution**: Installed and integrated `@tiptap/extension-text-style` package
- **Technical Implementation**:
  ```bash
  npm install @tiptap/extension-text-style
  ```
  - Added TextStyle extension to editor configuration
  - Updated imports in CreatorEditor.tsx
  - Font family dropdown now has proper backend support

### 3. **Optional Word Progress with Goal Mode**
- **Original Issue**: Word progress always visible, should be optional
- **Solution**: Implemented "Goal Mode" setting accessible via settings gear icon
- **Features**:
  - Settings modal with "Goal Mode" toggle
  - When enabled: Shows NaNoWriMo-style progress tracking (daily/total word goals)
  - When disabled: Hides word progress completely
  - Persistent setting stored in component state

### 4. **Enhanced Content Writing Area**
- **Original Issue**: Content writing section not clearly defined
- **Solution**: Added visual indicators and styling improvements
- **Improvements**:
  - Clear border around content writing area
  - Focus states with blue border highlight
  - Better visual separation from navigation
  - Improved styling for better user experience

## Technical Details

### Editor Extensions Configuration

  }),

  }),
  FontFamily.configure({
    types: ['textStyle'],
  }),
  TextStyle, // ← New extension for font functionality
]
```

### Goal Mode Implementation
```typescript
const [goalMode, setGoalMode] = useState(false)

// Conditional rendering in UI
{goalMode && (
  <div className="writing-goals">
    {/* Word progress tracking */}
  </div>
)}
```
