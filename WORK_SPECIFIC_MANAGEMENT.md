# Work-Specific Content Management System

## Overview
Implemented work-specific management pages for glossary terms and character profiles. Instead of managing all content globally, creators now select which story they want to work on, then access that story's specific content.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Sidebar Reorganization**

**Before:**
```
- Upload
- Dashboard
- Manage Stories
- Draft Management  ❌ (removed)
- Analytics
- Profile
```

**After:**
```
- Dashboard          (home overview)
- Upload             (new content)
- Manage Stories     (edit/publish)
- Fanart             (approve submissions)
- Quality            (AI assessments)
- Analytics          (reader insights)
- Glossary           (work-specific) ✨ NEW
- Characters         (work-specific) ✨ NEW
- Translations       (future)
- Monetization       (future)
- Settings           (creator preferences)
```

### 2. **New Pages**

#### `/creator/glossary`
- Shows grid of all creator's works
- Each card displays:
  - Cover image (or gradient placeholder)
  - Story title
  - Chapter count
  - Glossary term count
- Click card → `/creator/works/[id]/glossary`
- Search functionality
- Empty states (no stories, no results)

#### `/creator/characters`
- Shows grid of all creator's works
- Each card displays:
  - Cover image (or gradient placeholder)
  - Story title
  - Chapter count
  - Character count
- Click card → `/creator/works/[id]/characters`
- Search functionality
- Empty states (no stories, no results)

### 3. **New API Endpoint**

**GET `/api/creator/works`**

Returns all works for authenticated creator with counts:

```typescript
{
  success: true,
  works: [
    {
      id: "uuid",
      title: "Story Title",
      coverImage: "https://...",
      _count: {
        chapters: 15,
        glossaryTerms: 23,
        characters: 8
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
  w.id,
  w.title,
  w."coverImage",
  (SELECT COUNT(*)::int FROM chapters c WHERE c."workId" = w.id) as "chapterCount",
  (SELECT COUNT(*)::int FROM glossary_terms gt WHERE gt."workId" = w.id) as "glossaryCount",
  (SELECT COUNT(*)::int FROM character_profiles cp WHERE cp."workId" = w.id) as "characterCount"
FROM works w
WHERE w."authorId" = ${authorId}
ORDER BY w."createdAt" DESC
```

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│                         │
│     [Cover Image]       │
│     or Gradient         │
│                         │

└─────────────────────────┘
```

### Features

- **Responsive Grid**: 3 columns (desktop), 2 (tablet), 1 (mobile)
- **Search Bar**: Filter works by title
- **Loading State**: Spinner during fetch
- **Empty States**:

  - No search results → Adjust query message

## Upcoming: Sequel System

Next phase will add:

### Create Sequel Button
Location: Work management page

### Sequel Creation Flow
```
1. Click "Create Sequel" on existing work
2. Modal opens:
   ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
   │ Create Sequel                    │
   ├──────────────────────────────────┤
   │ New Title: [input]               │
   │                                  │

   │ ☑ John Smith (Main Character)   │
   │ ☑ Sarah Lee (Supporting)         │
   │ ☐ The Ancient Artifact (keep    │
   │    mysterious for sequel)        │
   │                                  │
   │ [Cancel] [Create Sequel] ───────→│
   └──────────────────────────────────┘
3. Creates new work with:
   - Empty chapters
   - Selected glossary terms (copyable/editable)
   - Selected character profiles
   - Link to parent work
4. Redirects to new work upload page
```

### Sequel Features

- **Mystery Mode**: Omit certain characters/terms for sequels
- **Edit After Copy**: All copied content is editable
- **Parent Link**: Readers can see "Sequel to [Work Title]"
- **Series Management**: View all works in a series

   - Work grid for glossary management
   - Search and empty states

2. **`src/components/CreatorCharactersPage.tsx`** (189 lines)
   - Work grid for character management
   - Search and empty states

3. **`src/app/creator/glossary/page.tsx`** (10 lines)

4. **`src/app/creator/characters/page.tsx`** (10 lines)
   - Page wrapper with AppLayout

5. **`src/app/api/creator/works/route.ts`** (68 lines)
   - Fetches works with counts

### Files Modified
1. **`src/components/Sidebar.tsx`**
   - Removed Draft Management
   - Added Glossary and Characters links
   - Added new icons (PhotoIcon, StarIcon, etc.)

### Database Schema
Uses existing tables:
- `works` - Stories
- `chapters` - Story chapters
- `glossary_terms` - Term definitions
- `character_profiles` - Character info

No schema changes needed (all tables already exist).

## Benefits

### Before (Global Management)
- All glossary terms mixed together
- Hard to find terms for specific story
- No way to see which story a term belongs to
- Confusing for multi-work creators

### After (Work-Specific)
- ✅ Clear separation by story
- ✅ Easy to find and manage content
- ✅ Visual work selection with covers
- ✅ See counts at a glance
- ✅ Better organization for series
- ✅ Prepares for sequel system

## Next Steps
