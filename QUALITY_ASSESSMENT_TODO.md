# Quality Assessment System - Implementation TODO

##  Overview

This TODO outlines the completion steps for the **AI-Powered Quality Assessment System** that intelligently evaluates story quality and helps readers discover great content.

###  What's Been Completed

The foundation is **100% complete** and ready for integration:

1. **Database Schema** (7 new models)
   -  QualityAssessmentQueue - Priority-based queue system
   -  QualityAssessment - Main assessment storage with scores, tags, boosts
   -  QualityAssessmentHistory - Version tracking
   -  AssessmentPromptTemplate - Template management
   -  AssessmentFeedback - User feedback collection
   -  LLMUsageLog - Cost tracking
   -  PromptTemplate - Prompt versioning
   -  Migration created: 20251013022010_add_quality_assessment

2. **LLM Integration** (Groq API)
   -  Service: src/lib/quality-assessment/llm-service.ts
   -  Model: Llama 3.3 70B Versatile (superior quality over speed)
   -  Cost: ~$0.002 per assessment (cheaper than OpenAI!)
   -  Free Tier: 1,000 assessments/day
   -  Smart prompt engineering for literary analysis

3. **Assessment Service**
   -  Service: src/lib/quality-assessment/assessment-service.ts
   -  Queue management with priority (high/normal/low)
   -  .chapt format parsing (all block types)
   -  7-day re-assessment cooldown
   -  Retry logic (max 3 attempts)
   -  Comprehensive error handling

4. **Type Definitions**
   -  Types: src/lib/quality-assessment/types.ts
   -  Consistent snake_case for quality tiers
   -  Full TypeScript coverage

5. **API Endpoints** (4 routes)
   -  POST /api/quality-assessment/queue - Add works to queue
   -  GET /api/quality-assessment/[workId] - Get assessment results
   -  POST /api/quality-assessment/process - Process queue (for workers)
   -  GET /api/quality-assessment/stats - Admin statistics

6. **UI Components**
   -  QualityCelebration.tsx - Celebration display with fireworks
   -  StoryManagement.tsx - Created but needs content (see TODO below)

7. **Documentation**
   -  QUALITY_ASSESSMENT_SYSTEM.md - Complete architecture docs
   -  GROQ_INTEGRATION.md - Setup guide and model comparison

8. **Dependencies**
   -  openai package installed (Groq-compatible)
   -  Environment variable: GROQ_API_KEY needs to be set in your Codespace

##  What Each Assessment Provides

For every first chapter published:
- **Overall Score** (0-100)
- **6 Dimension Scores**:
  - Writing Quality (25%)
  - Storytelling (20%)
  - Characterization (15%)
  - World-Building (15%)
  - Engagement (15%)
  - Originality (10%)
- **5-15 Discovery Tags** (e.g., slow-burn-romance, harry-potter-like, lgbtq+)
- **Quality Tier** (Exceptional/Strong/Developing/Needs Work)
- **Algorithm Boost** (1.5x, 1.2x, 1.0x, or 0.8x)
- **Constructive Feedback** (One encouraging sentence)

##  TODO: Integration Steps

### STEP 1: Complete StoryManagement Component 

**File**: src/components/StoryManagement.tsx

**Current State**: Empty file created

**What to do**: See the conversation history for the full component code. This component displays all authors works with quality assessment badges, discovery tags, and new assessment notifications.

---

### STEP 2: Integrate into Creator Dashboard 

**File**: src/components/CreatorDashboard.tsx

**What to do**:```typescript
import StoryManagement from './StoryManagement'

// Add to component state:
const [tab, setTab] = useState<'dashboard' | 'analytics' | 'stories'>('dashboard')

// Update button to actually work:
<button onClick={() => setTab('stories')}>
  Manage Stories
</button>

// Add tab content:
{tab === 'stories' && <StoryManagement />}
```

---

### STEP 3: Trigger Assessment on Publish 

**File**: src/app/creator/editor/page.tsx (or wherever publish logic lives)

**What to do**: Add this after successful first chapter publish:

```typescript
// After successful publish of first chapter
if (isFirstChapter) {
  try {
    await fetch('/api/quality-assessment/queue', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        workId: work.id,
        sectionId: section.id,
        priority: 'normal'
      })
    })
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to queue quality assessment:', error)
    // Non-critical, dont block publish
  }
}
```

---

### STEP 4: Set Up Background Worker 

**Option A - Vercel Cron (Recommended for production)**:

1. Create src/app/api/cron/process-assessments/route.ts
2. Add to vercel.json to run every 5 minutes

**Option B - Simple Node Script (For development)**:

Create scripts/process-queue.js:
```javascript
setInterval(async () => {
  try {
    await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/quality-assessment/process', {
      method: 'POST'
    })
    console.log('Queue processed at', new Date().toISOString())
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error processing queue:', error)
  }
}, 5 * 60 * 1000) // Every 5 minutes
```

Run with: node scripts/process-queue.js

##  Testing Checklist

Once integration is complete:

- [ ] Publish a test story with first chapter
- [ ] Verify it appears in queue: GET /api/quality-assessment/stats
- [ ] Manually process: POST /api/quality-assessment/process
- [ ] Check assessment appears: GET /api/quality-assessment/{workId}
- [ ] Verify it shows in StoryManagement component
- [ ] Test with different story genres
- [ ] Monitor token usage and costs

##  Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# Get your free API key from https://console.groq.com
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Optional - for Vercel Cron

```

### Database Migration

Already applied locally! In Codespace run:
```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

---

##  Monitoring & Maintenance

### Check Queue Status

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/quality-assessment/process
```

---

##  Quick Start (In Codespace)

```bash
# 1. Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Set GROQ_API_KEY in .env (get from https://console.groq.com)

# 4. Apply migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy

# 5. Complete TODO Steps 1-3 above

##  Summary

**Built**: Complete quality assessment foundation with Groq AI integration
**Remaining**: Wire up UI components and publishing flow integration (3-4 steps)
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours to complete integration
**Value**: Helps authors see quality metrics and helps readers discover great stories

The hard work is done - now just connect the pieces!
