## 🔥 RIGHT NOW: Add Environment Variables

Vercel is deploying, but **uploads won't work until you add the R2 credentials**.

### Go to Vercel Dashboard

1. Open **Vercel Dashboard**
2. Select your **Chapturs project**
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**

### Add These 8 Variables

**Copy from `VERCEL_ENV_SETUP.md` or here:**

```env
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=bcdec06776b58a6802e2c3face0f004c
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=cbe51f0c8d2f6f8044520e106c030fcf
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=0132ed719091206bd225da40c32b8c8b07b6d139531bbb96acc483d214267e92
R2_BUCKET_NAME=chapturs-images
R2_PUBLIC_URL=https://pub-bcdec06776b58a6802e2c3face0f004c.r2.dev
FREE_TIER_ENABLED=true
FREE_TIER_STORAGE_GB=10
FREE_TIER_OPERATIONS=1000000
```

**IMPORTANT:** For each variable, select:
- ✅ Production
- ✅ Preview  
- ✅ Development

### Trigger Redeploy

After adding all variables:

1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **"..."** on latest deployment
3. Click **"Redeploy"**
4. Wait ~2-3 minutes

---

## 🧪 Test It

Once Vercel finishes deploying:

### Visit Your Test Page

```
https://your-app.vercel.app/test-upload
```

### Try Each Upload Type

1. **Profile Picture** (3 MB limit)
   - Should compress to ~500 KB
   - Generate thumbnail + optimized

2. **Book Cover** (5 MB limit)
   - Should compress to ~800 KB
   - Maintain aspect ratio

3. **Fan Art** (8 MB limit)
   - Should compress to ~2 MB
   - Show 60-70% savings

### Check Results

For each upload, verify:
- ✅ Progress bar works
- ✅ 3 URLs returned (thumbnail, optimized, original)
- ✅ Images display correctly
- ✅ Compression savings shown
- ✅ Usage stats load

## 🐛 If Something Breaks

### "Failed to generate upload URL"

**Missing env vars**

Fix:
1. Verify all 8 variables added to Vercel
2. Check they're applied to Production
3. Redeploy

### "Network error" on upload

**R2 needs public access**

Fix:
1. Cloudflare R2 dashboard
2. Select `chapturs-images` bucket
3. Settings → Public Access → Enable
4. Save

### Images upload but won't display

**CORS not configured**

Fix:
1. R2 bucket → Settings → CORS
2. Add policy:
```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": ["https://your-app.vercel.app"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600
  }
]
```

## 🎯 What's Next

After verifying uploads work:

### 1. Integrate into Profile Editor

Replace URL inputs in `BasicInfoEditor` with `ImageUpload`:

```tsx
// Before
<input 
  type="url" 
  value={profileImage}
  onChange={e => setProfileImage(e.target.value)}
/>

// After
<ImageUpload
  entityType="profile"
  currentImage={profileImage}
  onUploadComplete={(img) => setProfileImage(img.urls.optimized)}
  label="Profile Picture"
/>
```

### 2. Monitor Usage

- Check R2 dashboard weekly
- Watch for 75% storage warning
- Set up alerts if needed

### 3. Scale Confidently

You're ready for growth:
- FREE until 1,000-2,000 users
- $1-5/month as you scale
- 91% cheaper than AWS!
