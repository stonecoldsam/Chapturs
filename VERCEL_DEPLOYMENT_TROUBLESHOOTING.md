# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

## Issue: Push to GitHub But Vercel Didn't Deploy

### Common Reasons & Fixes

---

## ✅ Quick Checks

### 1. Check if Auto-Deploy is Enabled

**In Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Go to your project → **Settings** → **Git**
2. Check **"Production Branch"** section
3. Make sure it says: `main` (or your default branch)
4. Check **"Auto-Deploy"** is enabled ✅

**If disabled:**
- Click **Edit** next to Production Branch
- Make sure **"Deploy on push"** is checked

---

### 2. Check Deployment Status

**In Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Go to **Deployments**
2. Look for your latest commit
3. Check status:
   - 🟢 **Ready** - Deployed successfully
   - 🟡 **Building** - Currently deploying
   - 🔴 **Error** - Build failed (click for logs)
   - ⚪ **Queued** - Waiting to build

**If you don't see your commit:**
- Vercel might not be connected to your repo
- Check Settings → Git → make sure repository is connected

---

### 3. Manually Trigger Deployment

**Option A: Redeploy Latest**

1. Go to **Deployments**
2. Find the latest deployment
3. Click **⋯** (three dots)
4. Click **Redeploy**
5. Confirm "Use existing Build Cache" or "Rebuild"

**Option B: Push Empty Commit**

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger deploy"
git push origin main
```

This forces a new deployment even without code changes.

**Option C: Use Vercel CLI**

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI (if not installed)
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy from terminal
vercel --prod
```

---

### 4. Check Build Logs for Errors

**If deployment failed:**

1. Go to **Deployments**
2. Click the failed deployment
3. Click **Build Logs** tab
4. Look for red error messages

**Common build errors:**
- ❌ Missing environment variables
- ❌ TypeScript errors
- ❌ Module not found
- ❌ Build timeout

---

## 🔧 Your Current Situation

Based on your description, the commit `85808f3` (auth fixes) was pushed but didn't deploy.

### What Just Happened:

✅ **Commit 85808f3**: `fix: Add AUTH_SECRET validation...`
- Pushed to GitHub successfully
- Should have triggered deployment
- But deployment didn't happen (or failed silently)

✅ **Commit 0e7293f**: `feat: Add Vercel Speed Insights...`
- Just pushed now
- Should trigger deployment
- Wait 2-3 minutes for build

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

When you push to GitHub, Vercel should:

- [ ] Detect the push via GitHub webhook
- [ ] Queue a new deployment
- [ ] Start building your app
- [ ] Run `npm install` and `npm run build`
- [ ] Deploy to production URL
- [ ] Show "Ready" status (takes 2-5 minutes)

**If any step fails, check:**
1. Vercel dashboard for error messages
2. Build logs for specific errors
3. Environment variables are all set

---

## 🎯 Verify Latest Deployment

**Check what's actually deployed:**

1. Go to **Deployments** → Latest
2. Check **Deployment Details**:
   - Git Commit SHA (should match `0e7293f`)
   - Deployment time
   - Build time
   - Status

3. Click **Visit** to see live site
4. Right-click page → **View Page Source**
5. Look for: `<script src="/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js">` ← Speed Insights!

## 🐛 Common Issues

### Issue 1: Deployment Skipped (No Changes)

**Symptom:** Push accepted but Vercel says "No deployment needed"

**Fix:** Vercel detected no changes (cache issue)
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "force rebuild"
git push origin main
```

---

### Issue 2: Build Failed (Missing Env Vars)

**Symptom:** Build fails with "AUTH_SECRET is not defined"

**Fix:** Add environment variables in Vercel:
1. Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add `AUTH_SECRET`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`, etc.
3. **Redeploy** (adding env vars doesn't auto-redeploy!)

---

### Issue 3: Deployment Timeout

**Symptom:** Build takes >10 minutes and times out

**Fix:** 
- Check for infinite loops in build scripts
- Optimize dependencies (remove unused packages)
- Split large builds into smaller chunks

---

### Issue 4: GitHub Webhook Not Working

**Symptom:** Pushes never trigger deployments

**Fix:**
1. Go to **Settings → Git**
2. Click **Disconnect** then **Reconnect** repository
3. This refreshes the webhook

---

## 📊 Monitor Current Deployment

**To see if it's deploying right now:**

1. Open Vercel Dashboard
2. Go to **Deployments**
3. Top entry should show:
   ```
   🟡 Building...
   Commit: 0e7293f
   Branch: main
   ```

4. Wait 2-3 minutes
5. Should change to:
   ```
   🟢 Ready
   Commit: 0e7293f
   Branch: main
   ```

---

## ✅ Success Indicators

**Your deployment succeeded when:**

1. ✅ Deployment status shows **Ready** (green)
2. ✅ Visit button works and shows your site
3. ✅ Commit SHA matches your latest push
4. ✅ Build time is recent (last few minutes)
5. ✅ No red errors in build logs

---

## 🚨 If Still Not Deploying

### Check GitHub Integration:

1. Go to **Settings → Git**
2. Verify **Repository** is connected
3. Check **Production Branch** is `main`
4. Try **Disconnect** → **Reconnect**

### Check Vercel Account:

1. Make sure you're in the right team/account
2. Check if project is paused (rare)
3. Verify billing is active (if on paid plan)

### Nuclear Option (Last Resort):

**Re-import project:**
1. Note all environment variables (export them)
2. Delete project from Vercel
3. Re-import from GitHub
4. Re-add environment variables
5. Deploy

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Enable Deployment Notifications

**Get notified when deployments succeed/fail:**

1. Settings → **Notifications**
2. Enable **Deployment Created**
3. Enable **Deployment Ready**
4. Enable **Deployment Failed**
5. Get emails for every deployment

### 2. Use Deployment Protection

**Prevent bad deploys:**

1. Settings → **Deployment Protection**
2. Enable **Preview Deployments** require auth
3. Test on preview before merging to main

### 3. Check Deployment Logs

**Always check logs after deploy:**

```bash
# In Vercel dashboard
Deployments → Latest → View Function Logs
```

Look for warnings about:
- Missing environment variables
- API errors
- Database connection issues
