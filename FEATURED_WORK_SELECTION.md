# Featured Work Selection - v0.2 Complete

## Overview
Creators can now choose what to feature prominently on their profile: a work from their portfolio, a custom block, or nothing.

## Implementation

### BasicInfoEditor Updates
Added featured content selection UI with three radio button options:

#### 1. Featured Work
- Dropdown to select from creator's published works
- Shows work title in dropdown
- Only available if creator has published works
- Shows warning if no works available

#### 2. Featured Block
- Dropdown to select from profile blocks
- Shows block type and ID prefix
- Only available if creator has added blocks
- Shows warning if no blocks available

#### 3. None
- Leave featured space empty
- Clean option for minimalist profiles

### ProfileData Schema
```typescript
interface ProfileData {
  // ... other fields
  featuredType: 'work' | 'block' | 'none'
  featuredWorkId?: string       // Set when featuredType === 'work'
  featuredBlockId?: string      // Set when featuredType === 'block'
}
```

### FeaturedSpace Component Updates
Now handles all three featured types properly:

#### Type: 'none'
- **Owner view**: Shows clickable empty state with "Click to select" message
- **Visitor view**: Shows simple empty state message

#### Type: 'work'
- Displays work cover image (or placeholder icon)
- Shows work title, genres, status
- Displays description with line-clamp
- "Read Now" and "Bookmark" action buttons
- Edit button (owner only) to change selection

#### Type: 'block'
- Dynamically renders the selected block component
- Parses block data from JSON
- Passes appropriate props (data, width, height, isOwner)
- Shows error message for unknown block types
- Edit button (owner only) to change selection

## User Flow

## Technical Details

### Block Rendering

<BlockComponent
  data={parsedData}
  width={2}

  isOwner={isOwner}
/>
```

```

## Database Integration

{
  featuredType: 'block',
  featuredBlockId: 'block-123',
  // ... other fields
}
```

const profile = {
  featuredType: 'work',
  featuredWorkId: 'work-456',
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Getting Featured Data
```typescript
// Based on featuredType:
if (featuredType === 'work') {
  // Fetch work data by featuredWorkId
  const work = await getWork(featuredWorkId)
}
if (featuredType === 'block') {
  // Find block in profile.blocks array
  const block = blocks.find(b => b.id === featuredBlockId)
}
```
