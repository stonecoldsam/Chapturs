# üîß FIX CORS ERROR - R2 Bucket Configuration

## ‚úÖ Good News!

The upload system is **working**! The API generated a presigned URL successfully.

The error is just **CORS configuration** - your R2 bucket needs to allow uploads from `https://chapturs.com`.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Fix in 2 Minutes

### Step 1: Go to Cloudflare R2 Dashboard

1. Open [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
2. Click **R2 Object Storage** in sidebar
3. Click your **`chapturs-images`** bucket

### Step 2: Configure CORS

1. Click **Settings** tab
2. Scroll down to **CORS Policy**
3. Click **Add CORS policy** or **Edit**

### Step 3: Add This Policy

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": [
      "https://chapturs.com",
      "https://*.chapturs.com",
      "https://*.vercel.app"
    ],
    "AllowedMethods": [
      "GET",
      "PUT",
      "POST",
      "DELETE",
      "HEAD"
    ],
    "AllowedHeaders": [
      "*"
    ],
    "ExposeHeaders": [
      "ETag"
    ],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600
  }
]
```

### Step 4: Save

Click **Save** or **Update CORS policy**

---

## üéØ What This Does

**AllowedOrigins:**
- `https://chapturs.com` - Your production domain
- `https://*.chapturs.com` - Any subdomain (like `www.chapturs.com`)
- `https://*.vercel.app` - Preview deployments

**AllowedMethods:**
- `PUT` - Upload files
- `GET` - Download/view files
- `DELETE` - Remove files
- `HEAD` - Check if file exists

**AllowedHeaders:**
- `*` - Allow all headers (needed for presigned URLs)

**MaxAgeSeconds:**
- `3600` - Cache CORS response for 1 hour

---

## ‚úÖ After Saving

**No redeploy needed!** Just refresh the page and try uploading again.

The CORS error will disappear and uploads will work! üöÄ

---

## üß™ Test Again

1. Go to `https://chapturs.com/test-upload`
2. Select an image
3. Click upload
4. **Should work now!** ‚úÖ

You should see:
- Progress bar ‚Üí 100%
- 3 URLs generated (thumbnail, optimized, original)
- Images display correctly
- Compression savings shown

## üêõ Still Not Working? Advanced Debugging

### 1. Verify CORS Policy is Actually Saved

In Cloudflare R2 Dashboard:
1. Go to your `chapturs-images` bucket
2. Settings tab ‚Üí CORS Policy
3. **Take a screenshot** of what you see
4. Make sure it shows the JSON policy (not empty)

### 2. Check R2 Bucket Settings

**Make sure Public Access is enabled:**
1. Go to bucket Settings
2. Check if **"Public access"** or **"R2.dev subdomain"** is enabled
3. You need the bucket to allow public access for presigned URLs to work

### 3. Test with Browser DevTools

Open your browser console while testing upload:

1. Go to `https://chapturs.com/test-upload`
2. Open DevTools (F12)
3. Go to **Network** tab
4. Try uploading
5. Look for the **OPTIONS** request (CORS preflight)
6. Check response headers for `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`

**What to look for:**
- ‚úÖ OPTIONS request should return **200 OK**
- ‚úÖ Response should include `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://chapturs.com`
- ‚ùå If OPTIONS returns **403**, CORS policy isn't working

### 4. Wildcard Subdomain Issue

Cloudflare R2 **may not support** `https://*.vercel.app` wildcards. 

**Try the wildcard-free policy above** with explicit domains only.

### 5. Wait for Propagation

CORS changes can take **2-5 minutes** to propagate. After saving:
- Wait 3-5 minutes
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Try in Incognito mode

### 6. Custom Domain vs R2 Direct URL

Your presigned URLs point to:
```
https://chapturs-images.bcdec06776b58a6802e2c3face0f004c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
```

This is the **R2 storage endpoint**. CORS must be configured on this bucket.

If you have a **custom domain** (like `images.chapturs.com`) pointing to R2:
- CORS must be on the **bucket**, not the domain
- The domain just proxies to the bucket

---

## üîß Quick Fix: Try Wildcard CORS First

**Fastest way to test if CORS is the actual issue:**

1. Change CORS policy to allow **all origins** (`"AllowedOrigins": ["*"]`)
2. Save and wait 2 minutes
3. Try upload again
4. If it works ‚Üí CORS was the issue, just need to fix the origin format
5. If it still fails ‚Üí Different issue (see below)

---

## ‚ùå If CORS `*` Still Doesn't Work

Then it's **NOT a CORS configuration issue**. Could be:

### A. Presigned URL Signature Issue
- R2 credentials might be wrong
- Time sync issue (server time vs R2 time)
- Bucket name mismatch

**Check Vercel environment variables:**
- `R2_BUCKET_NAME` must exactly match bucket name in Cloudflare
- `R2_ACCOUNT_ID` must match your R2 account ID
- `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` must be valid

### B. Bucket Permissions
- Bucket might not allow uploads even with presigned URLs
- Check R2 bucket **permissions** settings

### C. R2 Free Tier Limits
- Check if you've exceeded R2 free tier limits
- Go to R2 dashboard ‚Üí Check usage

---

## üêõ If Still Not Working

### Double-check the bucket name in CORS

Make sure you're editing the **`chapturs-images`** bucket, not a different one.

### Check for typos

The policy must be **valid JSON**. Use a JSON validator if unsure.

### Try with wildcard (RECOMMENDED FOR TESTING)

Cloudflare R2 might not support wildcard subdomains like `https://*.vercel.app`. Try this **simpler policy for testing**:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE", "HEAD"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag", "Content-Length"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600
  }
]
```

**This allows all origins.** Use this to test if CORS is the issue. If uploads work with this, then we know the wildcard subdomain format was the problem.

### After Testing with `*`:

If uploads work with the wildcard policy, switch to this **specific policy without wildcards**:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": [
      "https://chapturs.com",
      "https://www.chapturs.com",
      "https://chapturs.vercel.app"
    ],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE", "HEAD"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag", "Content-Length"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600
  }
]
```

## üìä What's Working Now

- ‚úÖ R2 credentials configured
- ‚úÖ Environment variables in Vercel
- ‚úÖ Prisma client generated with Image model
- ‚úÖ API generating presigned URLs
- ‚úÖ Authentication working
- ‚è≥ CORS configuration needed ‚Üê **YOU ARE HERE**

---

**Next step: Add CORS policy to R2 bucket and test!** üéØ

It's the last step before uploads work! üéâ
