5. Community engagement

### Phase 2 (Months 2-3)

2. Mobile app prototype (if demand exists)
3. Begin monetization planning
4. Set up payment processing infrastructure

### Phase 3 (Months 4-6)
1. Launch monetization (tips, subscriptions, ads)
2. Platform Premium beta
3. Writing contests system
4. Advanced analytics for creators

## ðŸŽ¯ Minimum Viable Public Launch (MVP)

If you want to go public ASAP, here's the absolute minimum:

### Must-Have:
1. âœ… Login works (done)
2. âœ… Legal docs (done)
3. âœ… Basic moderation (reports + manual review)
4. âœ… Mobile-responsive UI
5. âœ… End-to-end testing complete
6. âœ… OAuth app published (out of test mode)
7. âœ… Error handling & logging

### Nice-to-Have (can wait):
- Email notifications
- Advanced analytics
- SEO optimization
- Content seeding
- LLC formation (can do while in beta)

## ðŸš€ Recommended Timeline

**Week 1: Testing & Bug Fixes**
- End-to-end workflow testing
- Mobile responsiveness fixes
- Cross-browser testing
- Fix any critical bugs

**Week 2: Moderation & Safety**
- Build basic reporting system
- Create moderator dashboard
- Add content warnings

**Week 3: Polish & Optimization**
- Error handling improvements
- Loading states and UX polish
- Performance optimization
- SEO basics

**Week 4: Pre-Launch Prep**
- Publish OAuth app
- Set up business emails
- Create support documentation
- Prepare launch announcement

**Week 5: LAUNCH! ðŸŽ‰**
- Soft launch to small community
- Monitor for issues
- Gather feedback
- Fix bugs quickly

**Weeks 6-8: Post-Launch Iteration**
- Implement feedback
- Add missing features
- Plan monetization rollout

## ðŸ’¡ My Recommendation

**Option A: Cautious (6-8 weeks)**
Complete everything above, seed some content, invite beta testers, polish heavily before public launch.

**Option B: Aggressive (2-3 weeks)**
Focus on:
1. End-to-end testing (complete your current todo)
2. Basic moderation tools
3. Mobile responsiveness
4. Publish OAuth app
5. LAUNCH in beta mode

**Option C: Middle Ground (4 weeks) - RECOMMENDED**
1. Week 1: Complete testing, fix critical bugs
2. Week 2: Build basic moderation, mobile fixes
3. Week 3: Polish UX, publish OAuth, setup emails
4. Week 4: Soft launch with "Beta" tag, gather feedback

The platform is already quite functional. You could technically go public now, but having moderation and testing done will save you headaches later.

**What do you want to tackle first?**
