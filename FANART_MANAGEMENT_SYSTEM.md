### 2. **Submission Cards**
Each submission card displays:

FROM image_submissions ims
JOIN character_profiles cp ON cp.id = ims."characterId"
JOIN works w ON w.id = cp."workId"
LEFT JOIN users u ON u.id = ims."submittedBy"
WHERE w."authorId" = ${authorId}
AND ims.status = ${statusFilter}  -- if not 'all'

## Files Created

1. **`/src/app/api/creator/fanart/route.ts`** (105 lines)
   - GET endpoint for fetching all creator's submissions
   - Status filtering and counting
   - Cross-work aggregation

2. **`/src/components/CreatorFanartPage.tsx`** (418 lines)
   - Main fanart management page
   - Filter, search, and review functionality
   - SubmissionCard component with modal

3. **`/src/app/creator/fanart/page.tsx`** (5 lines)
   - Page route wrapper

## Security

### Authorization
- Only authenticated creators can access
- Creators can only view submissions for their own works
- Review actions verify work ownership before updating

### Data Validation
- Image URLs validated before submission
- Status transitions validated (pending â†’ approved/rejected)
- User IDs verified through session auth

### Rate Limiting
Consider adding rate limits for:
- Submission fetching (prevent spam refreshing)
- Review actions (prevent accidental rapid clicking)

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Pagination**: Add for creators with 100+ submissions
2. **Image Lazy Loading**: Load images as they enter viewport
3. **Caching**: Cache status counts for 30 seconds
4. **Thumbnails**: Generate thumbnails for grid view (load full on modal)
5. **Virtualization**: Use virtual scrolling for large lists

### Current Performance
- Single query fetches all submissions (suitable for <1000 submissions)
- Status counts calculated separately (efficient with indexes)
- Client-side filtering (fast for <100 items)
