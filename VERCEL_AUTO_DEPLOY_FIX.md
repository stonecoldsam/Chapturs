# 🔧 Fix: Vercel Auto-Deploy Stopped Working

## The Problem

After a manual redeployment, Vercel stopped automatically deploying when you push to GitHub.

**This is a common issue** - the GitHub webhook connection can break during manual operations.

---

## ✅ Quick Fix (2 minutes)

### Option 1: Reconnect GitHub Repository (Recommended)

**In Vercel Dashboard:**

1. Go to your **Chapturs** project
2. Click **Settings**
3. Click **Git** in the sidebar
4. Scroll to **Connected Git Repository**
5. Click **Disconnect** (don't worry, this is temporary!)
6. Click **Connect Git Repository** 
7. Select **GitHub**
8. Choose your repository: **stonecoldsam/Chapturs**
9. Click **Connect**

**This refreshes the webhook and auto-deploy should work again!** ✅

---

### Option 2: Check Auto-Deploy Settings

**Verify auto-deploy is enabled:**

1. Go to **Settings → Git**
2. Under **Production Branch** section:
   - Should show: `main`
   - **Deploy automatically** should be checked ✅
3. If unchecked, click **Edit** and enable it

---

### Option 3: Verify GitHub Webhook (Advanced)

**Check if webhook exists in GitHub:**

1. Go to your GitHub repository: `github.com/stonecoldsam/Chapturs`
2. Click **Settings** → **Webhooks**
3. Look for a webhook pointing to `vercel.com`
4. Should show:
   - ✅ Green checkmark (recent deliveries successful)
   - ❌ Red X (webhook failing - delete and reconnect in Vercel)

---

## 🧪 Test Auto-Deploy

After reconnecting, test it:

```bash
# Make a small change
git commit --allow-empty -m "test: Verify auto-deploy working"
git push origin main
```

**Expected result:**
- Within 10 seconds: New deployment appears in Vercel
- Status changes: Queued → Building → Ready
- Takes 2-3 minutes total

## 🐛 Common Issues After Manual Redeploy

### Issue 1: Webhook Disconnected

**Symptom:** Pushes to GitHub don't trigger deployments

**Cause:** Manual redeploy sometimes breaks the webhook connection

**Fix:** Reconnect repository (Option 1 above)

---

### Issue 2: Wrong Branch Selected

**Symptom:** Deployments work on other branches but not main

**Cause:** Production branch setting changed

**Fix:**
1. Settings → Git → Production Branch
2. Make sure it's set to `main`
3. Click Save

---

### Issue 3: Deployment Paused

**Symptom:** No deployments trigger at all

**Cause:** Project might be paused (rare)

**Fix:**
1. Go to project overview
2. Look for "Paused" banner
3. Click Resume if paused

---

## 📋 Verification Checklist

After fixing, verify these settings:

- [ ] Settings → Git → Connected Git Repository shows **stonecoldsam/Chapturs**
- [ ] Settings → Git → Production Branch is **main**
- [ ] Settings → Git → **Deploy automatically** is checked
- [ ] GitHub → Webhooks shows Vercel webhook with green checkmark
- [ ] Test push triggers new deployment

---

## 🔄 Alternative: Use Vercel CLI

If GitHub integration keeps breaking, deploy directly:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI (one-time)
npm i -g vercel

# Link project (one-time)
vercel link

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

**This bypasses GitHub** but requires manual deployment each time.

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Enable Deployment Notifications

Get notified when deployments happen (or don't):

1. Settings → **Notifications**
2. Enable:
   - ✅ Deployment Created
   - ✅ Deployment Ready  
   - ✅ Deployment Failed
3. Add your email

**Now you'll know immediately if auto-deploy breaks!**

---

### Use GitHub Actions (Advanced Alternative)

If Vercel's auto-deploy keeps breaking, use GitHub Actions:

Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Vercel
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v20
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
          vercel-args: '--prod'
```

**More reliable but requires more setup.**

---

## ✅ Recommended Solution

**For your situation, do this:**

1. **Disconnect and Reconnect** GitHub repository in Vercel (Option 1)
2. **Test with empty commit** to verify it works
3. **Enable notifications** so you know if it breaks again

**Takes 2 minutes and should fix it permanently!** 🚀

---

## 🆘 If Still Not Working

### Last Resort: Re-import Project

**Only if everything else fails:**

1. **Export environment variables** (Settings → Environment Variables → copy all)
2. **Delete project** from Vercel
3. **Import from GitHub** again
4. **Re-add environment variables**
5. Auto-deploy will work with fresh setup

**This is nuclear option - try Options 1-3 first!**

---

## 🎯 Summary

**Your auto-deploy broke after manual redeploy.**

**Quick fix:**
1. Go to Vercel → Settings → Git
2. Disconnect repository
3. Reconnect repository
4. Done! Auto-deploy restored ✅

**Test:**
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "test auto-deploy"
git push origin main
# Should see new deployment in Vercel within 10 seconds
```

**Try Option 1 (reconnect) and let me know if it works!** 🎯
